<h1>An Introduction to HuggingFace Models</h1>

1. Pipeline
2. AutoModel
3. Pre-trained Model

<h4>Pipeline</h4>
Pipelines are ideal for quick application of pre-trained models to specific tasks without extensive coding.<br>
They handle input preprocessing, model execution, and output postprocessing.<br>
Users have limited control over model architectures, hyperparameters, and training procedures, which may restrict flexibility for specific use cases, as They offer limited customization options.

<h4>AutoModel</h4>
Users can fine-tune or customize various aspects of the model, such as architecture, tokenizer, optimizer, learning rate scheduler, and training procedure.<br>
This level of customization allows for fine-grained control over the entire NLP pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.<br>
You have less direct control over the model architecture itself.<br>
Fine-tuning AutoModels is less straightforward compared to working directly with the pre-trained model.<br>
You might need to dig deeper into the underlying code to access fine-tuning capabilities. <br>

<h4>Pre-trained Model</h4>
Pretrained models offer the most flexibility and control over model configuration and training process.<br>
Users can fine-tune pretrained models, adjust hyperparameters, modify architectures, and integrate with custom components to tailor the model to their specific needs.<br>
Pretrained models are suitable for advanced users or researchers who require full control over every aspect of the NLP pipeline.<br>
